# Project Name: Sprint 7 Project
# Project Description: A series of tests using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE request methods. These tests all involve /api/v1/kits.
# Technologies Used: VS Code, Node.js, and Jest primarily.
# Techniques Used: I tested server responses using asynchronous test (from Jest) methods. I also placed the server url in config.js to reduce code redundancy.
# Instructions: Using VS code, with Node.js and the Jest package installed, type 'npm test {filename}' into the terminal after changing to the hm07-QA-US/tests directory.
